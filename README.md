### What is the scope of the project?

The HTML file that is included in the repository was one of my first data-analysis-related university assignments for a module called *Exploratory Data Analysis*.

We were given a dataset with all the crime records for a particular Police Office in Dallas. The scope was to use R (in particular R Markdown along with the ggplot2
library) to create a *html* file with a short analysis of the situation. 

**Remark:** Since the assigment did not ask for the R code, the R Markdown file that is included hasn't been optimized or formatted properly and the code is messy. However, I decided to include for anyone interested in the process behind it.
